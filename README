# Detlef_Schrempf

Following my NBA 3 Pointer analysis (https://crawstat.com/2020/05/27/the-nba-3-pointers-staggering-rise/), a reader asked how Detlef Schrempf stacks up. As Schrempf is one of my all-time favorite shooters, I was curious to find out myself.

Schrempf was a small forward for the Seattle SuperSonics and a lethal 3 point (and mid-range) shooter complementing Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton during the team's storied '90s run. He was a 3-time All Star and and 2-time 6th Man of the Year. He also played for the Dallas Mavericks, Indiana Pacers, and Portland Trailblazers. Sidenote: he made a cameo in three episodes of one of my favorite shows Parks and Recreation.

Let's take a look at how Schrempf stacks up from 3 point range. Notice that for his career, while he was fairly in line with the league in 3PAr, he was leaps and bounds above in 3PA, 3P%, and 3P. What made him a such an efficient shooter was his 3P% (and FG% and FT%). For example, in his 1994-1995 Sonics campaign, his FG%/3P%/FT% was a deadly 52/51/84.
